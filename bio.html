<h1>Pete Fenwick</h1>

<p>
Out of the lush valley of Bellingen, Pete has been riding the Sydney circuit for over 15 years.
<p>

At the ripe age of 37, Pete has honed his acoustic guitar and vocals to appeal to all walks of life.
<p>

From blues to punk, folk to funk, world music and fusion- the boy became a man of many hands and uses them to entertain and 'wow' the audience.
<p>

In the last 2 years, Pete has performed in a variety of events such as: this year's Ashfield Festival (headliner Archie Roach); Marrickville Cultural Festival; BurnByNight Festival, Goulburn; Ashfield's Food and Gourmet Festival; Lazy Bones Club, Marrickville and Arnclif's Street Performance Festival.
<p>

At the moment, Pete's gathering the 40 plus recordings from his past endeavours for a brand new web site and is currently in a new outfit called 'Clown Bird' with top artist, Justine Wahlin, which mixes the Australian Blues and Roots side of the coin.
<p>

Pete's shows are one of a kind. He spouts words from the heart with a cracking back beat to make any old shed a hoe down to remember.
